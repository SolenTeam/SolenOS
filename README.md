# 🌞 SolenOS
A tiny, lightning-fast, fully customizable OS — built just for fun, experiments, and pure curiosity.

SolenOS boots fast, installs fast, and lets you tweak almost everything.  
If you like lightweight systems, clean structure, and messing around with your own OS, you’ll feel right at home.

## 🚀 Why SolenOS?
Because sometimes you just want an OS that:
- doesn’t take itself too seriously  
- is easy to build  
- is fun to customize  
- and doesn’t require a 2GB toolchain to compile  

SolenOS uses simple Node.js tooling, so setup is basically instant.

## ⚡ Features
- Super lightweight — boots in seconds  
- Fully customizable — themes, backgrounds, presets, and more  
- Node-powered build system — no weird toolchains  
- Clean file structure — easy to explore and hack on  
- Fast development cycle — change something, rebuild, done  
- Multiple presets included — minimal, colorful, retro, etc.  

## 🧩 Presets Included
SolenOS comes with a bunch of tiny, lightweight presets you can swap in and out:
- Backgrounds  
- Color themes  
- Layout styles  
- Minimal UI options  
- and more!

They’re all super small and easy to modify — perfect for experimenting.
